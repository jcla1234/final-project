        <h2> About me! </h2>
        <p>
            My name is Sophia Rodriguez-Kellett. I was born and raised in Ottawa with my parents and my 3 siblings. I
            was born on July 22<sup>nd</sup> 2004. I grew up visiting my family from Panama, as my mother was born there, so I've spent a lot of time
            experiencing both sides of my culture. I love to travel and see the world, and I hope to one day visit some
            of the top places on my list!

            I have a passion for the arts and all things technology. I am currently taking Interactive media design at
            Algonquin college to further my knowledge on the things that I really enjoy. In the future I hope to own my
            own business and work remotely as the idea of being my own boss really motivates me to be good at what I am
            doing.
