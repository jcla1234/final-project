                    The Beatles, an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960, consisting of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr, are widely considered the most influential band ever. They played a crucial role in the 1960s counterculture and elevated popular music as an art form. Their music, rooted in skiffle, beat, and 1950s rock 'n' roll, blended classical and traditional pop elements in creative ways. They explored various music styles, from folk and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock.

                    On April 10, 1970, McCartney announced he was leaving the group, leading to media frenzy and worsening tensions among the band members. Legal disputes dragged on, and the official breakup wasn't confirmed until December 29, 1974.  The Beatles' last live performance took place on the rooftop of the Apple building at 3 Savile Row, London, on January 30, 1969. This event marked the climax of their Let It Be film. In preparation for this historic moment, The Beatles wrote and rehearsed 14 new songs as they geared up for their first live show in over two years.
                    
                    "Hey Jude" remains their biggest hit, and they're the top-selling artists worldwide, with 183 million certified albums in America alone.
