                    <p class="story-text"> The Beatles, an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960,
                        consisting of John Lennon, Paul
                        McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr, are widely considered the most influential band
                        ever.
                        They played a crucial role in the 1960s counterculture and elevated popular music as an art
                        form.
                        Their music, rooted in skiffle, beat, and 1950s rock 'n' roll, blended classical and
                        traditional
                        pop
                        elements in creative ways. They explored various music styles, from folk and Indian music to
                        psychedelia and hard rock.
        
                        On April 10, 1970, McCartney announced he was leaving the group, leading to media frenzy and
                        worsening tensions among the band members. Legal disputes dragged on, and the official
                        breakup
                        wasn't confirmed until December 29, 1974. The Beatles' last live performance took place on
                        the
                        rooftop of the Apple building at 3 Savile Row, London, on January 30, 1969. This event
                        marked
                        the
                        climax of their Let It Be film. In preparation for this historic moment, The Beatles wrote
                        and
                        rehearsed 14 new songs as they geared up for their first live show in over two years.
        
                        "Hey Jude" remains their biggest hit, and they're the top-selling artists worldwide, with
                        183
                        million certified albums in America alone.</p>
